# Tutorials Directory

This folder contains step-by-step Screeps tutorial scripts for learning automation, logistics, and strategy in Screeps: World.

## Structure

- Each subfolder (e.g., `tutorial-1/`, `tutorial-2/`, ...) is a self-contained lesson.
- Tutorials are designed to be incremental: start with basic harvesting and building, then progress to more advanced logistics and control.

## How to Use

1. Open a tutorial folder and review its `main.js` and role modules.
2. Follow the comments and code patterns to understand each concept.
3. Use these as a reference for building your own scripts in `src/`.

## Notes

- Tutorials are excluded from production linting and formatting.
- Patterns here may be simplified for teaching; production code should follow stricter contracts and modularity.

## Next Steps

- Try modifying a tutorial script to add a new role or behavior.
- Compare tutorial code to your main codebase for best practices.
